# Burger

#### About
Restaurant-ish app utilizing MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 


#### Overview
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the name(s) of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
